# Google Search Console Setup Guide

This guide will help you register your website with Google Search Console so Google can index it.

## Step 1: Create a Google Search Console Account

1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Add Property" or "Add a property"

## Step 2: Add Your Website

1. Select "URL prefix" option
2. Enter your website URL: `https://cptsd.in`
3. Click "Continue"

## Step 3: Verify Ownership

Google will ask you to verify that you own the website. You have several options:

### Option A: HTML Meta Tag (Recommended - Easiest)

1. Google will provide you with a meta tag like:
   ```html
   <meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE" />
   ```

2. Add this verification code to your `.env.local` file:
   ```env
   GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION=YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE
   ```

3. The code is already set up in `app/layout.tsx` to use this environment variable.

4. After adding the environment variable, rebuild and redeploy your site.

5. Click "Verify" in Google Search Console.

### Option B: HTML File Upload

1. Google will provide you with an HTML file (e.g., `google1234567890.html`)
2. Download the file
3. Place it in the `public/` directory of your `cptsd-main` app
4. Commit and deploy
5. Visit `https://cptsd.in/google1234567890.html` to confirm it's accessible
6. Click "Verify" in Google Search Console

### Option C: DNS Record

1. Google will provide you with a TXT record to add to your DNS
2. Go to GoDaddy DNS Management
3. Add a TXT record:
   - Type: TXT
   - Name: `@` (or leave blank)
   - Value: `google-site-verification=YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE`
   - TTL: 600
4. Wait for DNS propagation (5-30 minutes)
5. Click "Verify" in Google Search Console

## Step 4: Submit Your Sitemap

After verification:

1. In Google Search Console, go to "Sitemaps" in the left sidebar
2. Enter your sitemap URL: `https://cptsd.in/sitemap.xml`
3. Click "Submit"
4. Google will start crawling your site

## Step 5: Request Indexing (Optional)

You can manually request Google to index specific pages:

1. Go to "URL Inspection" in Google Search Console
2. Enter a URL (e.g., `https://cptsd.in`)
3. Click "Request Indexing"

## Step 6: Monitor Your Site

After setup, you can:

- View search performance in "Performance" section
- See which pages are indexed in "Coverage" section
- Monitor for errors in "Coverage" section
- Check mobile usability in "Mobile Usability" section

## Important Notes

- It may take a few days to a few weeks for Google to fully index your site
- Make sure your `robots.txt` allows Google to crawl (already configured)
- Keep your sitemap updated (automatically generated by Next.js)
- Add new content regularly to improve indexing

## Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local` or production environment:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://cptsd.in
GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION=your-verification-code-here
```

## Troubleshooting

### Sitemap not found
- Make sure your site is deployed and accessible
- Check that `https://cptsd.in/sitemap.xml` is accessible
- Verify the sitemap format is correct

### Pages not being indexed
- Check "Coverage" section in Search Console for errors
- Ensure `robots.txt` allows crawling
- Make sure pages have proper metadata
- Request indexing manually for important pages

### Verification failed
- Make sure the meta tag is in the `<head>` section
- Clear your browser cache
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Check that the verification code matches exactly
